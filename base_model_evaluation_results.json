Vitamin C is also important in the absorption and utilization of other essential nutrients, such as iron and calcium, and it helps to maintain the health of the cardiovascular system. In addition, vitamin C plays a role in the production of enzymes and hormones, which are essential for various bodily functions. Therefore, a diet that includes sufficient amounts of vitamin C can contribute to overall health and wellness.</s>",

This technique is particularly effective when used in combination with other gardening practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and fertilization.\n\nWhen used correctly, companion planting can help your garden by:\n\n1. Preventing pests: Some plants have natural predators or repellents that can help keep pests away. For example, planting marigolds next to tomatoes can help repel aphids, which can damage tomato plants.\n\n2. Reducing disease: Some plants have natural disease-fighting abilities. For example, planting marigolds in a garden can help prevent and control aphids, which can damage tomato plants.\n\n3. Improving soil health: Some plants have beneficial microbes that can improve soil health. For example, planting garlic in your garden can help improve soil fertility and prevent soil-borne diseases.\n\n4. Enhancing the ecological balance: Companion plant",
